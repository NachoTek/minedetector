# Build Progress - Minesweeper Portable Executable

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-22T14:15:00Z
**Status**: PREPARATION COMPLETE - AWAITING UNRESTRICTED ENVIRONMENT FOR BUILD

---

## Summary

All build configuration, documentation, and preparation work is **COMPLETE and VERIFIED**.

The actual executable cannot be created in this worktree due to security restrictions that block Python/pip/PyInstaller commands.

---

## What's Complete ✓

### Phase 1: Build Configuration Setup ✓
- [x] requirements.txt updated with PyInstaller>=6.0.0
- [x] .gitignore updated to exclude build/, dist/, *.spec

### Phase 2: Initial Build and Spec File Generation ✓
- [x] main.spec created with proper PyInstaller configuration
- [x] build-dev.bat script created
- [x] build-dev.sh script created
- [x] TESTING-PROCEDURE.md created (14 test cases)

### Phase 3: Production Build - Single File Executable ✓
- [x] build-prod.bat script created with correct flags
- [x] build-prod.sh script created with correct flags
- [x] CONSOLE-WINDOW-VERIFICATION.md created

### Phase 4: Documentation and Build Instructions ✓
- [x] README.md with comprehensive build instructions
- [x] Distribution notes (SmartScreen, antivirus warnings)
- [x] Troubleshooting section

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Testing and Verification ✓
- [x] SUBTASK-5-1-VERIFICATION-GUIDE.md (12 E2E steps)
- [x] SUBTASK-5-2-STANDALONE-EXECUTION-VERIFICATION.md (7 procedures)
- [x] SUBTASK-5-3-REGRESSION-TEST-ANALYSIS.md (static analysis)

---

## What's Pending (Requires Unrestricted Environment) ⚠️

### Build Execution
- [ ] Build dist/Minesweeper.exe using PyInstaller
- [ ] Verify executable size > 5MB
- [ ] Verify executable launches without console window

### E2E Testing
- [ ] Execute all 12 E2E verification steps from SUBTASK-5-1-VERIFICATION-GUIDE.md
- [ ] Test all game features in packaged executable
- [ ] Document E2E test results

### Standalone Execution Testing
- [ ] Execute standalone verification from SUBTASK-5-2-STANDALONE-EXECUTION-VERIFICATION.md
- [ ] Test on machine WITHOUT Python installed (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Document standalone execution results

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Run pytest tests/ -v (if tests/ accessible)
- [ ] Static analysis already confirms zero regression risk

---

## Environmental Blocker

**This worktree has security restrictions that prevent**:
- Running `python` commands
- Running `pip install` commands
- Running `pyinstaller` commands
- Running `pytest` commands

**Result**: The executable cannot be built in this environment.

**Resolution**: Execute build and testing in an unrestricted environment.

---

## Build Instructions (For Unrestricted Environment)

When you have access to an unrestricted environment, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Build Production Executable
```bash
# Option A: Use the build script (recommended)
build-prod.bat          # Windows CMD
# OR
./build-prod.sh         # Git Bash/Unix

# Option B: Run PyInstaller directly
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name=Minesweeper --clean main.py
```

### 3. Verify Build
```bash
# Windows
dir dist\Minesweeper.exe

# Unix/Git Bash
ls -lh dist/Minesweeper.exe

# Expected: File exists and size > 5MB (typically 5-15MB)
```

### 4. Test Executable
Follow the comprehensive verification guides:
- SUBTASK-5-1-VERIFICATION-GUIDE.md (E2E testing - 12 steps)
- SUBTASK-5-2-STANDALONE-EXECUTION-VERIFICATION.md (Standalone testing - 7 procedures)

### 5. Run Unit Tests (if available)
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

---

## Verification Status

### Configuration Verification ✓
- [x] requirements.txt contains PyInstaller>=6.0.0
- [x] .gitignore excludes build/, dist/, *.spec
- [x] main.spec configured with console=False
- [x] build-prod.bat uses --windowed flag
- [x] build-prod.sh uses --windowed flag

### Documentation Verification ✓
- [x] README.md contains build instructions
- [x] README.md contains prerequisites section
- [x] README.md contains troubleshooting section
- [x] README.md contains distribution notes

### Security Verification ✓
- [x] No eval() usage
- [x] No exec() usage
- [x] No hardcoded secrets
- [x] PyInstaller is legitimate build tool

### Static Analysis Verification ✓
- [x] Zero lines of application code modified
- [x] All changes are build infrastructure only
- [x] PyInstaller is build-time dependency only
- [x] Regression risk is ZERO

## Next Steps

### Immediate Action Required

**Choose one of the following paths**:

#### Path A: Execute in Unrestricted Environment (Recommended)
1. Navigate to main repository or local clone
2. Follow "Build Instructions" section above
3. Complete all verification steps
4. Commit the executable with results

#### Path B: Accept Manual Build Requirement
1. Acknowledge that automated build is blocked by environment
2. Document that user must run build scripts manually
3. Close task with "manual build required" status

---

## Notes

- All work that could be completed in this restricted environment is done
- Build configuration is verified correct
- Documentation is comprehensive
- The only blocker is the inability to execute PyInstaller commands
- This is an environmental limitation, not an implementation failure
- Static analysis confirms zero regression risk from all changes made

---

**Last Agent**: QA Fix Agent (Session 1)
**Assessment**: Implementation Complete, Execution Blocked by Environment
**Recommendation**: Execute build in unrestricted environment
