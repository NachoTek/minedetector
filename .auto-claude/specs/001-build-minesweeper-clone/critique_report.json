      "fix_applied": "Replaced recursive flood_fill() function with iterative stack-based implementation. Updated code example uses a stack list and while loop to process cells, avoiding potential stack overflow on large boards. Also updated Key Points to clarify that stack-based iteration should be used, not recursion.",

      "description": "Contradictory wording in flood fill Key Points (line 155) stated 'Use recursion or stack-based approach to avoid stack overflow' - this is confusing because recursion CAN cause stack overflow. This contradicted the clear warning on line 278 to use iterative approach.",
      "location": "Flood Fill Algorithm section Key Points (line 155)",
      "fix_applied": "Updated wording from 'Use recursion or stack-based approach to avoid stack overflow on large boards' to 'Use stack-based iteration to avoid stack overflow on large boards (Expert: 480 cells)'. Removed mention of recursion as an acceptable approach. Also clarified that numbered cells (1-8) stop the flood fill rather than 'stop recursion'.",

  "critique_summary": "Found and fixed 3 issues in the Minesweeper spec. The most significant was a recursive flood fill algorithm example that contradicted the spec's own warnings about stack overflow on large boards. This has been corrected to show an iterative stack-based approach. Also fixed contradictory wording about recursion being acceptable, and corrected a numbering error in the Edge Cases section. Overall, the spec is well-written and technically accurate, with proper alignment to research findings. All issues have been resolved.",

    "The spec is now ready for implementation. All technical patterns align with research findings.",
    "Consider clarifying the first-click safety enhancement (protecting neighbors, not just the clicked cell) in documentation as this goes beyond Windows Minesweeper's original behavior.",
    "No additional issues found - the spec provides comprehensive implementation guidance with proper algorithms, edge cases, and acceptance criteria."
